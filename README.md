# Lab-Manual-Tasks
Task 1: Data Exploration (World Happiness Report 2024)
Loaded the World Happiness Report 2024 dataset into R.

Explored data using:

head(), summary(), and str() functions.

Checked for missing values using sum(is.na()).

Created an R Markdown file (.Rmd) to document findings.

Saved the cleaned dataset if modifications were needed.

Task 2: Basic Data Visualization (Climate Change Dataset)
Used ggplot2 for visualization.

Created:

Line Chart showing global temperature change over time.

Scatter Plot of COâ‚‚ emissions vs. temperature anomaly.

Exported plots as PNG images.

Compiled results into an R Markdown HTML file.

Task 3: Data Cleaning (E-Commerce Dataset)
Used Jupyter Notebook (R Kernel) for data preprocessing.

Cleaned the Online Retail dataset:

Removed rows with missing CustomerID.

Replaced missing values in UnitPrice and Quantity with their median.

Saved the cleaned dataset as processed_online_retail.csv.

Task 4: Classification Model (Diabetes Prediction)
Loaded the Diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv).

Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict diabetes (Outcome).

Printed the accuracy score.

Implemented the task in Jupyter Notebook (R Kernel).
